        Jake Naimark is the Vice President of Columbia Outdoors Club and a member of the class of 2020! He hails from the beautiful (and significantly underrated) state of New Hampshire. His favorite outdoor activities include hiking, skiing, and biking, and when he isn’t on an outdoor adventure (for whatever reason) he loves to sing, play piano, and read! When (if) he grows up, he hopes to dedicate himself to a career in environmental and/or agricultural sustainability. His favorite outdoors spot is New Hampshire’s White Mountains, though when he’s in the city, look out for him in Central Park. He can’t wait to spend time with you enjoying the beauty of planet Earth at the next Outdoors Club event!

        Brian is a senior from Southern California and is currently studying astrophysics (stargazing is the best activity to do in the outdoors at night!) and philosophy in hopes of one day becoming a patent attorney. He’ll never turn down an opportunity to go backpacking and you can find him running in the parks of NYC regardless of the weather. Memories of his favorite backpacking trip include having to take mountain lion safety training and making friends with a wild stag that approached him. If he can’t make it as a lawyer, Brian plans to disappear into the woods to spend the rest of his days living off the land.
